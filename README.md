## Overview

- Implementation of Pretrained Large Language Model Based News Recommendation using Python / PyTorch.
- We adopted **Neural News Recommendation with Multi-Head Self-Attention(NRMS)[]**, known for its high performance among neural news recommendation methods, as our model.
- We are using language models such as **BERT** as the backbone to obtain embedding vectors for news content.
